# ReleaseHelper

Release Helper is an app that I put together to help me get information about the files (exe installer or zip archive) that I plan to release here on GitHub.

### Features
- Simple user interface.
- Accepts file name via open file dialog, drag & drop, command line parameter, pasting the file name, or by typing.
- Calculates SHA265 hash for the input file.
- Calculates size to two decimal places.
- Shows file name without path.
- Easily copy the above three to the clipboard.
- Optionally submit the installer or zip archive to VirusTotal for analysis.
  - Submission to VirusTotal requires a VirusTotal account and API key.
  - Check results on [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/) using the generated hash.
- While there isn't a Settings page, the Settings file can be accessed via the three-dot menu.
